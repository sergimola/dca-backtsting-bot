# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates are determined by `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and include at minimum:
- No Live Trading enforcement (simulation-only)
- Green Light Protocol: entire test suite must be Green before merges/feature work
- Fixed-point arithmetic requirement for all monetary math
- Single-position invariant and Gap-Down execution rules
- Architecture constraints (core engine in Rust/Go; adapters outside domain)

Plans MUST explicitly list how the feature meets these gates and include links to
the BDD acceptance scenarios and TDD unit tests that validate compliance.

```

### Source Code (Polyglot Architecture)

<!--
  MANDATORY ARCHITECTURE: This project follows a strict polyglot design with two distinct domains.
  Do NOT deviate from this structure. The core engine (Go/Rust) must remain free of orchestration,
  API, or UI concerns. Adapters go in infrastructure/. Always specify which domain a feature belongs to.
-->

```text
core-engine/             # Go/Rust - Pure Domain, Fixed-Point Math, State Machine
├── domain/              # Core trading logic, state machines, event schemas
├── infrastructure/      # Isolated Adapters (ClickHouse, Broker, message queues)
└── tests/               # Unit + integration tests proving parity with canonical Python bot

orchestrator/            # TypeScript/Python - API, Workload Distributor
├── api/                 # REST/GraphQL endpoints, request routing
├── jobs/                # Queue publishers, workload distribution
└── ui/                  # Web/CLI interfaces
```

**Feature Placement Contract**: Every feature MUST explicitly state whether it belongs to
`core-engine/` (mathematical, state, domain) or `orchestrator/` (API, jobs, UI). Core-engine
tasks MUST NOT include HTTP, API, or UI logic.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
